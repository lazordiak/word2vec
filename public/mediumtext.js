let mediumtext = ["The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams. Let us, then, be up and doing. With a heart for any fate.— Eleanor Roosevelt, seen on a banner hanging outside of a pachinko parlor/gambling den, Nakano Japan.This is a story about how mistakes can turn into something beautiful and disgusting. Yesterday, I admit, I screwed up. I thought my flight was at 11:45 PM the 15th, but when the receptionist kindly pointed out that I was a day early I was stuck! An extra day in Tokyo, two heavy bags, and nothing to do. I figured the least I could do was provide for the community, and seeing as how this is a desperately unfilled niche I present to you the fruits of my last day in Japan: I have sampled only the finest cafe au laits from in and around Japan’s numerous vending machines, and compiled a list here so you can be sure that, when you arrive in Nakano ward 13th Chome, you know the right choice to make. BOSS: Tagline boss coffee, the boss of them all since 1992.I am 100% sure boss gets by on name brand alone. The bottles are TINY for 130 yen. On the other hand, their branding is good: the line on the coffee read “mild and creamy taste for a relaxing moment”, which are all words I enjoy hearing. It certainly was mild and creamy, but it still had the coffee note. All in all, a good introduction to vending machines cafe au laits for anyone in need of a Tokyo quick fix. GEORGIA EUROPEAN: I’m always tempted to refer to this one as just “Georgia” but I believe the full name is actually “Georgia European”, in which case I’m not certain what this is referring to — there’s only one state of Georgia in Europe I’m aware of and I don’t think they’re known for their coffee, though I hate coffee and so I could be wrong. Anyway, this bottle was huge compared to boss coffee, at least twice as big for the same price. I don’t know if boss got their hooks into me or what, but this tasted a bit more watery, and I feel like the coffee note was weaker. All in all, a fine option if you need to be drinking a lot of cafe au lait but going into an actual cafe is too intimidating because people keep screaming “IRASSHAIMASE” at you. WONDA: At this point I was getting a little tired of drinking vending machine cafe au laits, but lo and behold Wonda was on sale: only 100 yen a bottle (if you didn’t know vending machines could have sales, now you do). This coffe is by Asahi, the makers of the famous “#1 super dry beer” you may be familiar with, and they seem to have taken a page out of boss’s playbook because this bottle is tiny as well (a fact I’m not too upset by). The taste is similar to boss too, and in fact the coffee note might be a little stronger. Drinking this I can definitely tell you that Georgia is a bit too watery. EDIT: that’s Georgia European. It’s fine, drinkable, maybe even better than boss. My suggestion is that you and a friend get one of each and compare — or for this price, maybe even two!!SAPPORO: My god, another one. Sapporo is also getting into the vending machine cafe au lait market, and not a moment too late (quick note that all of these vending machines are within 50 feet). Sapporo, for those unfamiliar, is the Budweiser to Asahi’s Corona, except Sapporo comes from the far north of Hokkaido. I can’t think of what else Hokkado is really known for, except its rugged wilderness beauty and the last enclaves of the Ainu people, though they’re not doing so well lately. Enough politics, though, you’re here for the taste!! … It’s got a weird aftertaste. I can’t even say this tastes like boss, which is what I want to say, because it’s got this weird aftertaste. Avoid.ITO EN: Finally cleared out that group of vending machines, but around the next corner are at least four more, some of which have multiple brands of cafe au lait in the same machine, which makes no sense to me. I refuse to believe that anyone, even the Japanese, can meaningfully differentiate between this vast range of vending machine cafe au laits, although perhaps I’m wrong and this is the logical endpoint of all culture. As Marx once said, “Something about the endless accumulation of vending machine cafe au laits”. Anyway, Ito En. The bottle says “20% something”, though I’m not sure what it means. I know 用 is a kanji that refers to “task”, so maybe it refers to 20% less of a task to drink this vending machine cafe au lait cause boy is it tiny. It also says “2” near the top, which I can’t begin to parse. Taste: Surprisingly good. Also a distinct aftertaste, but not unpleasant. You could drink this one. You could drink any of them. It’s all the same. They’re all the same.DOUTOR: I can’t do this for much longer, mostly because I’m wired as shit after drinking five or six vending machine cafe au laits in a row. Passersby are giving me strange looks, no doubt wondering why I’ve been standing on this street corner for one hour hitting up the same vending machines for different brands of cafe au laits. Someone, this may have been Marx again, once said “Insanity is drinking the same vending machine cafe au lait and expecting different results”, which seems pertinent. Doutor was in the same vending machine as Wonda, which confused me, but maybe Asahi doesn’t mind a little healthy competition. Also of note is that the bottle says “hot and cold”, which is a bold claim. It just seems like a strange thing to offer, especially when there’s no hot option on the vending machine. Are they suggesting I go home and microwave it?Hold up, someone else is ordering.False alarm, he bought green tea. Weak.Anyway, Doutor. This one’s in a bottle with a twist off cap, which is new. I’ve been popping the caps off these babies like cans of coke, which I imagine is an experience similar to snapping a rabbit’s neck: perhaps initially thrilling when you’re overcome by the vigor of the hunt, but later you’re overcome by a wave of revulsion and, ultimately, regret. Taste: Very strong initial coffee note, otherwise similar to Georgia. It even looks the same as Georgia bottle-wise, and it has the same amount of coffee in it. EDIT: That’s Georgia European. Consider them identical, or don’t. No longer my problem.TULLY’S COFFEE：This is the last one I can do, literally, without throwing up, so I’m going out with a bang. Clocking in at 150 yen this is the most expensive of the vending machine cafe au laits available, although I’m not actually sure if this is really a cafe au lait at all. It comes in a strange, silvery bottle and also sports the label “hot and cold” — again, not taking them up on that. Uh. Where was I. Right. Yeah, so I’ve seen Tully’s Coffee shops actually around, like Starbucks, so they’re definitely established. I’m not sure if it’s a foreign brand or one of those Japanese brands that you just think are foreign, like Family Mart or 7–11 (did you know 7–11 was acquired by a Japanese company? I didn’t until I came here. They’re also a bank, which is weird, weird to have your convenience store also be your bank. Official name: 7 and Holdings.). Taste: I was fooled. It’s not a cafe au lait at all. It’s just coffee, and I hate coffee. Avoid. This is what the first world looks like. If you want a picture of the future, refer to the famous Marx quote: “Imagine a vending machine cafe au lait stomping on a human face, forever”.Keep in mind this is far from the entirety of the vending machine cafe au laits available. This is just two street corners, and later in the day I spotted at least five more brands. Trying to sample them all is a futile gesture, like trying to capture all Pokemon; it’s just a matter of time before more show up. The consumer is left with two choices: to resign themselves to the futility of the task and collect new cafe au laits ceaselessly, or to revel in a purpose that has been granted to them without end — an existential well which will never run dry.Until next time this is travel extraordinaire SD signing off. Stay safe, everyone, and remember — すごいです！！！","Time in Japan seems so discrete, or rather discretely proportioned. There is time wandering around the mountains feral among the beasts and birds, but it has all been vanished from Tokyo and the other cities — as if the rivers carried it away when they paved them in concrete, or maybe when the cities were rebuilt again and again there was no place for it to hide anymore. I imagine to myself that the people gathered up all the rest of it they could then and held it in the shrines and buried it with the dead for safekeeping, and that that is where it all is now, in the shrines and the graves and the tall forests and the windy mountains.Sometimes I wonder if time is something we find or if we grow it naturally, like our other bones.","At the Mori Art Tower…You go up to the top, and the elevator goes up to the top — that’s fifty floors (more, actually) up to the top, though it’s very fast, and then you can see all the rest of Tokyo all out in front of you like one of those real-life looking picture-map looking things… Or is that just holograms I’m thinking of?Much has been written on museums as the death of art and culture — I’m thinking particularly of something I once read in Susan Sontag’s Against Interpretation, but there is plenty of discourse for those who want to look for it. Most of it, or at least the parts which I find most relevant, have to do with the strip-mining of context. Consider the Nike of Samothrace. Someone, I hear, once called it “the greatest masterpiece of Hellenistic sculpture”, which seems a bit silly; I would think the greatest masterpiece of Hellenistic sculpture would come with the head still attached, or maybe at least one arm. Looking at this, what are we to imagine? What are we to see? Is it anything beyond what it is? Could it ever be, and to whom? Sometimes inspiration can be slow to come in the museum, and I don’t feel guilty about this.This is a tidy encapsulation of a bigger problem, which is that a work in a museum often loses all its identity except for that of a museum work. In this sense the Mori Art Tower’s exhibition on Japanese architecture manages to neatly sidestep that issue. It’s always seemed to me that architecture had the bigger end of the stick here anyway, because as far as the arts go it’s the kind with the most context set out for us all packed-in included. Most architecture, and most of the architecture in this exhibit, is for using: for living, working, thinking, breathing, like the buildings live work think and breathe themselves as a magnified reflection of their contents, never meant to be anywhere but where they are (what a blessing!).The exhibit uses context well. It goes all-in on it. The buildings referenced in the pictures and videos are accompanied by scale models. The scale models are accompanied by pictures and videos. The pictures and videos are accompanied by a written description of the purpose, the origin, and (occasionally) the fate of the building. The scale model, pictures, videos, and written description are accompanied by huge quotes in big bold letters that sit near the tops of the walls. “I know not who is there, but my gratitude moves me to tears,” reads one — fair. “Only the beautiful is functional,” is another — yes, I think I could say so. “The complex is comprised of the inseparable relationships of happenstance connections of outdoor and indoor, public and private — a living room, a bath in a sunroom, a tree shaded porch, a small inner garden or an alleyway — linked via the spaces entered through the interstices.” This one is my favorite. It sounds like someone started describing a building, but got lost and ended up talking about life in general. On good days, I feel like a bath in a sunroom.There is lots of water and nature, in the Japanese style. Some houses are surrounded by water. Some are underwater. Some are covered in snow. One looks out onto a lake. There is wind, too: this one circulates the sea breezes, this one is extra-thick so tsunamis don’t knock it over. This one is a teardrop, or a raindrop, or maybe just metal. In one part of the exhibit there is a small one-room hut which admits entrance. Inside is a single character, of the sort you meditate under.In retrospect, it’s almost funny — maybe standing there and walking among the many miniature buildings one could posit themselves as a sort of Godzilla, moving sedately through pint-sized Japanese environs. On the contrary, though, I felt quite small, and quite made of glass, as if the models were for me, and I would be made to go and live in them, a static figure. If living is purpose of any sort, then that would be living with purpose, of some scintillating, crystalline kind. If there is a failure of some sort to be found here, it will be that the real living can never approach that sort of living. I’m not sure real living has ever approached anything, though, not even itself.Two thumbs up!","“man was matter,that was snowden’s secret. drop him and he’ll fall. set fire to him and he’ll burn, like other types of garbage. the spirit gone, man was matter. that was all.”It seems to me sometimes that there is nothing very meaningful or original I can say about death — this could be a sin inherent in death itself or else an expression of my own inexperience, but the fact remains that when I search for something new to say in the wake of it all I’m faced with are the same trite niceties. And yet here we are, so I guess I haven’t learned my lesson, huh?I am not really a stranger to death per se, nor is it something that particularly affects me emotionally, at least in my own opinion. My mother works in hospice, where dying is not only a possibility but an expectation, even a necessity. Even so, there is a strange aspect to death that blots out its surroundings, leeching them of color — some sort of mental effect, rather than an emotional one. For a little while the expectation of death is everywhere again. I wonder about the idea of habituation and the insidious effect it has on the human mind. The first time I realized I would die and could not stop it I cried for a day; now I really couldn’t cry if I tried, and it’s only a real death that can jar a little of that sediment.On our way back from Kapilvastu in Nepal, out examining the pillars of the four Buddhas born in the area, we hit a dog (a puppy, really). By the time we came back a minute later it was dead, and the blood had stopped leaking from the head, mostly. It is the blood that struck me immediately, and I looked at it for as long as I could. I knew that out of all of it the blood is what I would remember. It seemed the realest part. The rest was all the same: the 200 rupees (roughly 2 dollars) paid for the death, the prayer we said, or the way the man picked up the corpse, or the way the corpse looked when the man picked it up. Life, if it can have any price at all, I think is priceless in that it is worth nothing, since all the rest is just quibbling over degree. If it had been 2 or 200 dollars for a dead dog, it would have seemed about the same. Circumstances are only incidental — where you are, how you look, what happens next are all things that have no real bearing.The blood, though, was a bright, bright red. It was aggressively bright, not even like something that belonged in a body; it seemed then brighter than anything I’ve ever bled, certainly, and I’ve bled my fair share. Mixed with that was a darker red, like how cooling magma might look, and around it was a clearer fluid of some sort, and where the whole liquid collage was too thin there was the speckled black of wet asphalt, which is its own striking color.It looked, I thought, exactly like a map might, maybe of two oceans meeting, or a road leading somewhere or other I couldn’t guess at. Blood, along with breath, is the most obvious truth we have. Sometimes I think about that, and the dead dog, and I feel a little bit more grounded.","Yesterday I attended a screening at Eyebeam in Brooklyn. Here at the outset I will take a minute to point out explicitly that in many ways, this screening could not include me. It is, at its core, about blackness, and I am not black, but the questions raised there do make me think, about my own identity and universal notions of identity and its construction in the age we’re living in now.That being said, here are the details, such as they are. Here is the video that was shown — and I thank God that I could find that video, after having wondered for a night how to describe it although, reflecting on it, maybe the video itself is part of the singularity now, and by summoning it through some techno-wizardry from one slat of the internet to another I have become part and parcel of the problem, enabling the data-driven echo chamber that enables the singularity’s dissolution of identity.But now I am getting ahead of myself. Let’s ask the obvious: what is the singularity? This was a key topic of the talk that followed the video. In layman’s terms, the idea is that it’s the event horizon of computing: the point where, like an avalanche, AI, algorithms, robots will gain so much momentum they will sweep themselves and us with them into some sort of new dawn which, depending on who you talk to, is either grey or glittering. In the context of the video, I think it is about becoming untethered to the physical realm and to direct causal connection. Place is obliterated. Context is obliterated. Entering into Google, where they recur endlessly, these are no longer images which refer to people, but rather artifacts — “spiritual machines”, from the title (which of course are thus so because they have entered the singularity)— that relate only to themselves and the vast, blind, squamous infrastructure that powers our search results.This infrastructure is not egalitarian, though. It’s not really a secret that Google’s algorithms (and by extension most algorithms) are biased, and why wouldn’t they be if most engineers are white? Besides, what each person gets is not what they put in: autocomplete results for “1 year old black boy” are going to be different for you and for me, based on where we are and, presumably, who are we. So now we’re faced with another question: if we are entering the singularity, then what sort of singularity is it, and for whose gain? One of the collaborators invited to the discussion panel said, bluntly, “if this is what the singularity is I want to opt out. I don’t want to be part of it”.This struck me — this idea of opting out of externally imposed representation or, venturing a bit further, even self-representation. What are we able to do, where does our right to opt out exist, how are we able to mold ourselves and our presentation of ourselves, and to what extent? We live in a strange world, rich with flux. As the digital melds with the physical, as each footprint of ours we leave online is whisked away to become another spiritual machine, as we get closer to the physical body swapping inherent in sci-fi stories like Ghost in the Shell, so our identities and perceptions are swapping in a similar way. Gender is not what it used to be. Nationality, even, is not what it used to be. We are not what we used to be, second by second. We are passing ourselves constantly in both digital and physical space, and that space ends up littered with the remnants of our backwards and forwards passing, things like these images, nameless, formless, ghostly.Is it true? This is what I was wondering as I turned onto Flatbush. How free are we, really, to define ourselves? How free are we to explore the definitions of ourselves we find? I thought about the things I had shied away from being defined as, other labels I have embraced, and other, tiresome things I could never escape, not in my whole life. Some identities, it seems to me, can be cast on and off like coats. Some identities shift and change naturally, like tides. And some identities are thrust upon us, like shackles. Perhaps one identity can be all those at once. A few blocks down, near Throop, it started raining. The street lights were on. It was beautiful, but certainly not a space of my own.","伏見稲荷大社 is a shrine in 京都市 dedicated to 稲荷大神, the god of prosperity. It lies at the base of a mountain, also called 稲荷, with another three shrines at the top. It is filled with thousands and thousands of 鳥居 planted by people hoping for success. In addition to prosperity, 稲荷大神 is the god of foxes, which I was happy to learn since my last name means fox and they are animals which I have always felt I have an affinity with for a number of reasons.The scariest thing, or at least the worst, which I learned while traveling is that there is no guarantee of any good in life. There is no guarantee you will end up happy, or with the person you love or with whom you are meant to be, or at the place which is waiting for you with a warm bowl of soup and a blanket, or in a job which fulfills you, or in a position to do any good in the world, or in a position to help anyone, even yourself. These things you want and need may never come to pass, though you will travel to the ends of the Earth, though you will travel beyond the ends of the Earth, though you will try your hardest doing the things you love and doing the things you hate, though you will run yourself raw and run yourself into the ground and run yourself to death. It is a horrible, horrible thing.Around eight or nine pm one day, I lost my way climbing 稲荷さん. I had wandered away from the thousand 鳥居 following a sign which said “ancillary shrine” and, later, “top of mount Inari” — “it’s the top, after all,” I thought, “and I’m always going up, right?” The sign was correct; it was a way up to the top of mount Inari, if not the way. It was pitch black, and I had to use my phone as a flashlight, and I hoped it would not die and leave me stranded. I climbed up stone steps and over wet soil. I crossed through someone’s rice field and snuck through someone’s driveway. The path forked, and the left fork ended where a series of fallen bamboo trees blocked the way forward, so I went back and took the right fork instead. I bought a bottle of tea from a lonely, glowing vending machine. I sat in a circle of light in a muddle of graves beside a cat, and we listened to the plink of dripping water and to the frogs croaking in the underground grates. “Are you a spirit?” I asked it quietly.The happiest thing, or at least the best, which I learned while traveling is the power of constructing your own narrative. We are, in the end, filled up only with the things we do, and of all those things it is the littlest ones which fill out our edges. We make these choices, these tiniest choices, alone and in secret: at night, tired, after working all day, in our favorite cafes and in our cars, out back behind the places we work, when no one else is looking, when our lover is distracted, when we are remembering something else we saw once or thinking of something we’ve never seen but wish to or thinking of nothing at all, at our most banal or when we are alone on the sides of mountains in the dark. These are our things. Often they are brief smiles and laughs and small, sudden choices. This is the peace of being ourselves, being sincere to ourselves, even accidentally, and we know ourselves better for it. I did not find fulfillment when I reached the top of the mountain and I have not found it since, but there was a small red ribbon which was myself which followed my footsteps up, through the graves and past the vending machine and coiled all around the dirt and the clay and the stones and my heart.","Here are things as I saw them, more or less, or at least as I just found them written in my phone:Nepal: you turn and see your friend laughing uproariously at the other end of the barhe meets your eyes and you start laughing too, though you dont really know whyChina: your friend said they would meet you at the entrance to the park, but they havent arrived yet across the square a couple buys something sizzling a vendorJapan: you are working at your computer when you slip into a daydreamoutside a few leaves fall the trees","When I was young, I got sick a lot. I had some sort of chronic ear infection — I don’t know the details, exactly, but it involved having lots of little tubes in my ears and being in pain.Later on, into my twenties, it’s different. I’m generally quite hale. But now that I don’t get sick very often, there’s something about sickness that mesmerizes me.Sometimes I look back upon sicknesses and illnesses, at least the more minor ones, with a certain fondness. There’s a big way in which a cold or even a flu makes me feel more real. For a time the body is less like a piece of machinery that’s working in the shadows, and more of something that’s part of you, that you depend on, that forces your attention. I felt more attuned to myself when I watched my temperature rise or my skin pale or turn black with pus, even though frankly that was gross and I wish my skin didn’t look like that. I loved, really loved and still do, the hypersensitivity that comes with sickness, when all of your nerves feel a bit sharper. You knew what to do when you were sick; you had a mission statement. Your attention was now focused on getting better. When we are sick, we are in tune with our environment in a special sort of way. Everything we are surrounded by becomes relevant.I had rituals for these times, as I expect a lot of people do. Eat soup, for instance. I personally would spend ten or twenty minutes in the bathroom, holding my hands under warm running water. Often I’d take a bath, and it would be a sea change to feel my heightened nerves go from cold to warm.Now here I am, sick in Beijing. I have — by my count — two or three infections, chills, and a complete loss of appetite. I spent most of yesterday in bed, and I’m spending most of today looking out the window, and it’s different. My sickness was born of this environment, and now I look for signs of my heavy breathing and pained leg in the the buildings and streets that are the skyline I see out my window.","Today I revisited Vassar College — I suppose technically the correct phrase to use here would be “my alma mater”, but it seems weird for me to say that. “I only graduated last year”, I protest feebly to myself, (though in reality it’s been a year and change) “and in fact it might as well have been yesterday. In any event, it’s perfectly alright that I’ve done nothing of value this past year and instead have spent the time ambling around cities and blogging. I’m barely a college graduate — in fact, I wouldn’t even say I’m a graduate at all — in fact, I never even went to college and the concept itself is unknown to me.”Well, anyway.The campus of Vassar is what I think of as “Hudson Valley picturesque”, all very green and appropriately chilly when September rolls around, kind of like the Sleepy Hollow of academia. There are cute farmers markets across the street every week. There are thick multitudes of fireflies which hover just above the lawn and are beautiful, though unfortunately there are also thick clouds of mosquitoes, which are awful. I consider this to be some sort of version of Newton’s Third Law, rendered organically: “for every wonderful bug there is an awful bug that deserves to be in hell.”Vassar has its own art gallery, and a pretty first-class one at that: The Frances Lehman Loeb. Here, every Thursday, you can attend Late Night at the Loeb, when the Loeb is open til nine and is the scene of minor festivities: not only is there free wine and cheese, but this is also the only place on campus you can get bottled water since the ban, making it doubly useful.Inside the Loeb there are many things, but here are two of them. One is a Mesoamerican statue of an old, angry looking man with elaborate headgear referred to as “The Old Deity”. In and of itself I wouldn’t find this super surprising, but here’s the kicker: Mesoamerican deities were never portrayed as old. In fact, this guy (as you’ll learn by reading the placard) isn’t referred to as the old deity because he’s old, but because he’s the old deity. He’s the only old one! The other deities are always portrayed as ageless or even young, but this guy goes around with a permanent old man scowl and tons of wrinkles. Learning this felt like being struck by a bolt of lightning which at the same time threw me off a cliff: I was overwhelmed by the beauty which context can bring to certain experiences, but at the same time I chafed at mine and anyone’s utter inability to be privy to that context, at least most of the time. It felt like one of those sliding block puzzles was happening in my mind. In short, I was grateful.There is another piece in the Loeb that’s stood there since I first arrived at Vassar, called “Sorcerer's Summer”. It is… how do I describe this. It’s a rectangle about six and a half feet tall and maybe a foot or so wide. It has grooves carved vertically along its side, from top to bottom, of varying distances so that the one big rectangle appears from different sides to be split into some number of smaller rectangles. Each of these rectangles are painted a different color, very subdued colors: dark purples, blues and dark turquoises. I have no idea what it’s carved from. The placard says “marine maple”, which is a wood I’ve never heard of, and it doesn’t explain anything about the purpose of the work. It is the exact opposite of the old deity, and I know nothing about it at all — but frankly I love it anyway. This one rectangle has inspired myriad unrelated thoughts in me: often it reminds me of Prospero, the wizard from Shakespeare’s Tempest, which is weird because I’ve never seen the play and know nothing about it. Other times it makes me think of some of the sweetest moments I’ve had at Vassar as the summer turned to autumn and the autumn cooled and turned to fall: baking pumpkin pies with the windows open in my kitchen, spread out on a blanket, outdoors, in the apple orchard, watching a play, looking past the actors and seeing the apple trees, looking past to the forest, and up into the sky. It’s a comfortable thing, Sorcerer’s Summer, at least it is to me; maybe the name is supposed to represent all the magical things that happen on drowsy summer evenings — or perhaps I’m insane.There are lots of cases where context, or the lack of it, is important to art. Rauschenberg’s Erased de Kooning is something that always comes to mind, and for a modern example of the “aesthetics of absence” you can check out this thought-provoking photo eraser from MIT. Sometimes knowing a lot about the history of art itself, and not just the piece in particular, can help foster an appreciation — I tend to think this is the case with Jackson Pollock’s paintings. In that kind of world, it brings me peace to see things like Sorcerer’s Summer; something to calm me down without explanation.","I dream almost every night. My friend suggested that maybe it’s because I spend so much time in unfamiliar places — because of that I don’t sleep as deeply, because my brain is always ready to alert me to danger. That may be the case. Whatever it is, I dream often and I usually don’t sleep well.Last night I dreamt I was near the summit of a mountain. I was part of an expedition to climb the tallest mountain in the world, to see what was there. With me were my three teammates and a prophet. We were clinging tightly to a cliff face; we could tell that we were almost at the top, but the final stretch was extremely treacherous. One of my teammates urged us to give up. We should stay here and wait for rescue, he said, because we’d never make it. The rest of the team thought we should try it, because we didn’t know if anyone would come for us or whether we’d be able to make it back down. The one man kept getting more and more stressed until he couldn’t take it anymore, then he jumped off (the prophet also jumped off).The rest of us decided to climb up. We barely made it. At the top of the mountain was a tram station with a tram. The lights inside were on and glowed warmly. We went in and shut the door, and it was nice and peaceful, it was warm inside. There was a refrigerator, couches, a TV; it looked like someone had built an apartment inside this tram. None of us really knew what to make of all this. We were a little stunned and still thinking about our friend who had jumped to his death from the cliff. When we sat down to think, the tram began to move. It jerked out of the station and into the air, floating through the sky, and as it passed over the world I looked down and saw lights from cities twinkling in the night. Eventually the tram pulled into a regular station at street level in some town I didn’t know the name of. A bunch of people came in, and they seemed as bewildered as us when they saw the inside, but they were all speaking Spanish and I couldn’t understand them. One woman was obviously very hungry, so I opened the refrigerator and tried to find something for her to eat. That’s when the dream ended.Lately I feel like I’m getting sucked into daily life. I’m thinking about getting a better paying job, or moving into a place I want, or what have you. This isn’t an inherently bad thing, and I’m sure a lot of people even enjoy it, but it’s not something I feel like I’ve ever wanted, or at least not something I ever wanted to want. It feels like I’m a snow globe that got shaken really hard, but now everything’s settling down. It could be that this is just what happens when people mature, but I’m not totally convinced about that yet. As of now I’d still prefer to live a second-order life — we’ll see how that goes.Outside it was raining even though the sky was clear, up until a minute ago.","Lately I’ve been thinking a bit about power. It’s always something my thoughts circle back around to in a circumspect way when I come back home, or at least to my parent’s home, or at least to my childhood home (I don’t know if I know where my home is).I think about power because I don’t have any here. That’s not necessarily unusual. There isn’t much… to do, in South Jersey. It’s very green, and I the climate agrees with me, because there’s a good part of the year where it isn’t too hot or too cold, and the flowers look really good in the spring even if the soil isn’t very nice, but nothing here really resonates with me. It’s a place full of people living their own lives, which in many situations is entirely admirable and the greatest thing you could hope for, but it’s not what I’m after at the moment. There’s a lot to be said on finding what kind of life you want to live, but mine’s not going to be in the pine barrens.Power is a multifaceted thing. Whoever said knowledge is power was undoubtedly right, because knowledge engenders informed action, and informed action is the most powerful sort of action, whether it’s knowing how to aim a gun at someone’s head or knowing what you need to say in order to get someone to listen to you or knowing which mushrooms to eat when you’re leading a group into the woods. So that’s one kind of power, and one I’ve had on and off over the past few years, mostly off when I travel to a new place, like a house that you have to build brick by brick. Then when you learn how things work you have more power, and sometimes you have even more power because people will judge you and not expect you to know certain things (or to be able to eat spicy food, in certain circumstances).Authority is also another important kind of power, and most of the time it doesn’t depend on knowledge and (I’d say) is more efficacious. If you’re the president you have power, if you’re someone’s boss of course you have power. Any title that someone ascribes to you can give you power — if someone assumes you’re straight, or a native, or rich, that gives you power (this is another kind of power I’ve ridden into ebbs and flows).I am, in a certain way, driven by a lust for power, as I think everyone is, because when you have power you have freedom; this isn’t a direct correlation, but generally the more powerful you are the freer you are, and as regards my own personal view of the world I firmly believe that everyone wants freedom within their own life. This doesn’t mean freedom on some grandiose scale, like anarchy, but rather the freedom to make one’s own decisions, act on them and see their conclusions through to a logical end. Most people have this freedom, in one way or another, even if only in the act of opening their fridge and choosing what to eat, and it’s only when we lack it (we can’t afford someone we want, someone is physically or mentally constraining us, we’re handicapped in some way and don’t have the necessary accommodations) that we find ourselves missing it.Dearth of opportunity is a lack of freedom in this way. If you can’t find any opportunity you’re essentially locked into one path without being able to make a choice about it. This is, essentially, why I enjoy learning new things and traveling. The more you learn to see things with fresh eyes, the more likely you are to find opportunity. When all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail, but it takes a bit of ingenuity to see that a screw could also be a nail, even if it’d be a shitty one.Lately, I’ve been really fortunate to be able to see opportunities where I hadn’t before. I’ve had some good people in my life, and I’ve been able to travel, and I’ve gotten to eat a lot of hot pot. I’m wondering about the freedom I have in my life, and lately I feel a responsibility to shift that from personal freedom, that is the ability to travel and sustain myself and generally do the things I want to do in a selfish sort of way, to freedom and authority that can help others — having a job in an influential industry, building up chops by associating with people who do good in the world, that sort of thing. I’ve spent most of my life staring over my shoulder looking out for myself, because I always suspected I wouldn’t have it very good and that I’d need to look out for #1, in a certain sense, but now I’d like to shift that worldview a bit and promote freedom wherever I can find it.Once, a long long long long time ago when I was very young, I had a golden ring with a gecko on it, and a pearl was set into the ring, but I lost that one day and could never find it again.","I must have written about this before, right? God knows I talk about it all the time.A few nights ago I went out to dinner with a wonderful Airbnb host I had, Andy, and his wonderful girlfriend, truly wonderful all around. We went to a North Korean restaurant, which I mean I think that it’s all staffed by North Koreans, whom I’m not sure if they’re there in some sort of official capacity (as in representing North Korea) or emigrated/escaped North Korea to China. Considering how chummy chummy Xi and Kim are, I feel like the former is more likely, or perhaps there’s a way for North Koreans to become Chinese citizens? This Airbnb host is from a small village in Hunan (I’ve met many wonderful people from Hunan lately), his wonderful girlfriend is from Inner Mongolia (I’ve developed a real love for Inner Mongolian food), and he got his Masters degree in a town in Japan near Kanazawa (ahh… Japan).Andy really liked Japan, which is understandable to me, because despite the many, many problems I would say Japan has, I still have a very soft spot for the country and I often find myself missing it. It’s a place where, without a lot of trouble, you can feel… comfortable. Maybe like you have a place where you can sit, relax, think, be yourself (have a home?)That’s what Andy told me, at least: he felt like, in that college town in Ishikawa, he’d had a home. In one sense this might just be a function of attending university, whose rigorous series of batteries is incredibly effective at fostering a sense of community, but I could also see how Japan is a country that is, in a lot of ways, conducive to community. Every town has a series of festivals, /lots/ of festivals, with all of them inextricably woven together into a tightly knit web of local culture, a web so tight it’s not hard to get caught up in it. For all of the country’s faults, there’s a sweetness in that, a real earnestness. I asked Andy if he felt that he belonged in that same way in China, in Beijing, if he felt that sense of community, or if he missed his hometown, and he said no. I asked his girlfriend the same question about her own life in Inner Mongolia, and she shook her head. Besides, she said, it’s very cold there.If you know me literally at all or have paid any iota of attention to my life in the past 2 and change years, you know I’ve been traveling a lot. I haven’t seen as many things as many people, but on the other things you can argue I’ve seen more things than most people. If I had to summarize my experiences, I’d say I’ve focused more than anything else on people and the environments that operate in them. Like Elon Musk’s atrociously named Boring Company, I’ve more and more doggedly dedicated myself to piercing through the mantle of small talk and facile appearances to find those webs that hold people in their places, all the little threads that dictate the paths they’ll follow. If I could I’d go straight to the deepest layer immediately after meeting a person, stripping each person to their skeleton and cracking their bones and drinking their marrow before building it all back up again from the bottom, and no I’m not sorry for how disturbing that imagery is.But a lot of the time you can’t see that kind of truth with your naked eyes. You have to kind of feel around the edges and get a general sort of shape of the thing, like recreating a sculpture with your eyes closed. Of course nobody has an answer when I asked them point-blank “Ok, what is Chinese culture?” I don’t expect them to, and I don’t think you /could/ answer a question like that. But it makes the problem all the more frustrating, because it definitely exists.Sometimes it feels like, in my quest to find out what makes identity tick, I myself have been sublimated, all my essential components vaporized and scattered to the wind, and have become an empty vessel to be filled up with Japanese culture, with Chinese culture, with Nepali culture. Certainly people have told me I have a Japanese soul because of the way I do calligraphy, that I’m basically a long-lost Chongqing native because of the way I gorge myself on spicy food and beer, or that I could be Nepali because… I don’t know, because I call everyone “bro”. But there’s a big difference between seeming like something and being something — even if it sounds like a dog and looks like a dog, it might not be a dog after all.So I guess what I’m saying is, it’s a tough question to try and find an identity. Here are some of the topics which have come up the most during all of the conversations I’ve had, along with my thoughts on them.Who determines cultural identity?Well? Who does? One of my friends told me a story about a friend of hers. This person was born in Korea, moved to China when she was eleven, but holds a Taiwan passport, since her mother is Taiwanese. She introduces herself as Korean to her friends, and ostensibly “feels” Korean, but lives in mainland China and puts her nationality as “Chinese” on all her job applications. Does she understand Chinese culture? Is she still Chinese if she understands Chinese culture but rejects it? Is she Chinese if she understands and embraces Chinese culture, but doesn’t have Chinese ID?Truthfully, I could decide to suddenly move to Japan or China, marry a citizen there, shed my US passport and gain a new one, get a job, master the language, live there for 20 years, and understand most everything there is to understand about the place (though some people might say that last part isn’t possible). Even if I did that, though, I am 99% sure people there not only wouldn’t assume I’m “Chinese” or “Japanese”, they wouldn’t accept me as such even if I told them all about the steps I’ve taken to assimilate. I would be lying if I said I didn’t think that a big part of that is based on appearance, though I’m sure it’s not the only factor. On the other hand, I do feel like that in America one can become an American, truly an American, in their lifetime, in far less than their lifetime. Maybe that’s naive of me, and certainly I am white and privileged, and certainly certainly there are many in America who, even though they were born here and perhaps even their parents parents were born here, still get told to “go back where they came from”.But if I felt, truly felt with all my heart, that I belonged some place and knew and understood it as well as any other, then are they right or am I? Do my feelings get taken into the accounting when determining who I am or where I’m ‘from’, or the judgments of other people, or just the judgments of the state? On the other hand, surely one can argue that the judgment of the nation-state, the issuer of passports and IDs, is the ultimate arbiter of identity. Is that correct?2. What role does one’s past and upbringing play in identity? Are you stuck to your past?This was something I didn’t expect to talk about, but which came up in a ton of the conversations people had with me, and which some people in particular were very impassioned about. What I kept hearing was the ways in which the past defines you, in ways which you are unable to shake off. People were telling me that if you were raised in a certain place, e.g. China, there were certain things you would never be able to shake off, and vice versa if you weren’t raised there there were certain experiences, formative ones, which you wouldn’t be able to go back and emulate.I’m by no means a denier of the permanent marks that childhood leaves on you as an adult. It’s very well documented that childhood trauma affects how your brain develops later on in life (so well documented I’m not even gonna link a link here), your diet, childhood obesity, physical environment you lived in, etc etc these are all very important, and the influence they have on you as you grow is in many ways (physically, at least) irreversible. … But I don’t know if I think the same way of cultural identity. This might be a personal thing, based on personal experiences. I never really felt like I belonged very well where I grew up, and I was more involved with the worlds of fantasy novels and video games than interacting and learning about what it means to be raised in South Jersey. Honestly, to this day there’s a lot of things I feel like I missed and still don’t understand about how people are supposed to behave and interact around one another. The fact of the matter is that a lot of the time it feels like I have the capacity to be a stranger even in a lot of the circumstances in which I should, ostensibly, feel at home, so the kind of effacement of identity to which the traveler is subjected is not entirely new to me (even if it is often exhausting).Besides, I’m a big advocate for being able to outstrip your past in general. I don’t think the past should be able to define what you do in the future or who you’re able to become. Many people grow up thinking certain things and acting certain ways, only to realize later that’s not what they wanted or who they were at all. That’s how I want life to be. I want to be able to constantly reinvent myself and explore new facets of my identity. Besides, going back to an earlier comment, I think that viewing cultural indicators on a merely surface level is a bit of a red herring. Is it possible that there are similarities in different cultural indicators that extend beyond appearances and can be linked, even in disparate circumstances? If Chinese culture values, say, filial piety, and I was raised in America in a family that overly emphasizes loyalty to one’s parents, can I not say I understand that aspect of Chinese culture, or does it have to do with the way that one feature interweaves with all the others to make a unique tapestry? And at the end of the day, I’m a little skeptical that there’s some magical ability we have in childhood that allows us to develop into a cultural creature that we lose when we’re older, akin to the linguistic critical period (although if anyone has any research on that please let me know).3. ConclusionObviously, the issue of identity is fraught with a number of problems, maybe the most pertinent of these being cultural appropriation. If an identity is one that’s traditionally been marginalized or looked down on, should you really be able to claim it as yours — especially if, for example, you don’t have to deal with all the downsides? If people in the slums of the Philippines have to literally survive off garbage they find outside of restaurants, and I feel like that’s an identity that resonates with me even though I grew up cooking my own food in a spacious kitchen, that seems a bit unfair.And, of course, just because I’m asking these questions IN NO WAY implies I’m claiming any of these identities as my own. Just because I’ve spent a few months in Beijing doesn’t mean I understand Chinese culture, certainly not. My questions are just a way of trying to quantify how we would know when someone has the right to be called “American”, “Chinese”, “Kenyan”, etc.Because I think something like that is possible."]
